# OPSEC
<b>Step 1: Identify critical information</b>

Critical information may include:
+ Intentions
+ Capabilities
+ Activities
+ Limitations

<b>Step 2: Analyse threats</b>

Answer the following questions:
+ Who is the adversary?
+ What are the adversary's goals?
+ What tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) do they use?
+ What critical information has the adversary obtained?

<i>threat = adversary + intent + capability</i>

<b>Step 3: Analyse vulnerabilities</b>

An OPSEC vulnerability occurs when an adversary can obtain critical information, analyse them, and affect your plans.


<b>Step 4: Assess risks</b>

Risk assessment requires the following:
+ Learning the possibility of an event taking place
+ Estimating the expected cost of the event
+ Assessing the adversary's ability to exploit vulnerabilities


<b>Step 5: Apply appropriate countermeasures</b>

Countermeasures are designed to prevent an adversary from detecting critical information, provide alternative interpretations of critical information/indicators, or deny the advesary's collection system.

Consider these factors:
+ Efficiency of the countermeasure in reducing the risk
+ Cost of the countermeasure compared to the impact of the vulnerability being exploited
+ Possibility that the countermeasure can reveal information to the adversary
