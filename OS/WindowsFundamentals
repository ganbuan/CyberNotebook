# Windows Fundamentals

## NTFS (New Technology File System)

NTFS is the modern file system used by Windows, replacing older systems like FAT32.

**Benefits:**
- Supports large files
- Lets you set **specific permissions** (who can read, write, or control a file)
- Allows **file/folder compression**
- Enables **encryption** with *EFS (Encrypting File System)*

**Permissions include:**
- Full Control
- Modify
- Read & Execute
- List Folder Contents
- Read
- Write

🔍 **Alternate Data Streams (ADS):**
A hidden feature in NTFS that allows files to carry additional, invisible metadata.

## Windows\System32

📁 **C:\Windows** is the main Windows directory. Its location can be referenced with the environment variable `%windir%`.

📁 **System32** is a critical subfolder that contains core operating system files—like the heart of Windows.

## User Accounts, Profiles & Permissions

👤 **Account Types:**
- **Administrator**: Full control (can add/remove users, change settings, etc.)
- **Standard User**: Limited to personal files and settings

🔐 **User Account Control (UAC):**
Acts like a “security guard”—asks for admin approval before sensitive changes are made.

🛠 Run `lusrmgr.msc` to open **Local Users and Groups Manager** (view/edit user accounts and groups).
